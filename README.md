# OpenGL-AtomSimulator

This is a mini project of computer graphics that demonstrates the simulation of an atom's structure using OpenGL.

## Features

- Simulates the structure of an atom, including the nucleus and electrons
- Allows the user to input the number of electrons in each shell
- Displays the name of the element based on the number of electrons
- Uses OpenGL for graphics rendering

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- OpenGL library
- GLUT library

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/OpenGL-AtomSimulator.git
   ```

2. Build and run the program:
   ```
   cd OpenGL-AtomSimulator
   make
   ./main
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch the program.
2. Press a number key (0-9) to input the number of electrons in each shell.
3. The program will display the name of the element based on the number of electrons.
4. Press any key to exit the program.
